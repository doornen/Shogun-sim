Assumptions made for 94Pd Coulex:
IntensityCalculator(130,0.55,208,250,0.2,0.85,0.9,1)
-> 3217 excitations 

For 98Cd:
root [4] IntensityCalculator(50,0.55,208,120,0.2,0.85,0.9,3)
 The produced gammas per day is: 594.015
 -> 3days. 1782 gammas

void IntensityCalculator(float beamRate, float targetThickness, float targetMass, float crossSection, float gammaEfficiency, float acceptance, float groundstate, float days)
